Project Overview:
The Age Calculator is a web-based application designed and developed by Code Alpha to provide users with a simple and efficient way to calculate their age based on their date of birth. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring a lightweight and responsive user experience.

Features:
* User-Friendly Interface: A clean and minimalistic design allows users to input their birth date easily.
* Real-Time Age Calculation: The system accurately calculates the user’s age based on the current date.
* Validation Checks: Ensures valid date inputs to prevent errors.
* Cross-Browser Compatibility: Works seamlessly on various web browsers and devices.

Technology Stack:
* HTML5: Structure of the webpage.
* CSS3 (if applied later): Styling and improving the user interface.
* JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Handles dynamic age calculation and validation logic.


How It Works:
1. Users enter their day, month, and year of birth in the input fields.
2. Upon clicking the "Calculate Age" button, the script processes the input and determines the age.
3. The calculated age is displayed instantly below the button.
4. The script also considers leap years and validates incorrect entries.

Future Enhancements (Optional Improvements):
* Implementing a modern UI/UX with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
* Adding a countdown to next birthday feature.
* Integrating an API for additional functionalities like zodiac sign predictions.
* Making it a progressive web app (PWA) for mobile accessibility.

Conclusion:
This Age Calculator is a simple yet effective tool that demonstrates Code Alpha’s expertise in front-end web development. The project serves as an excellent foundation for more advanced applications involving date-based calculations and user interactions.
